## 	Design and Implementation of a Distributed Load Balancing System with Java Load Balancer

This a simple program to demonstarte Load balancing in java using Round Robin and Random algorithms with the help of multiple built in methods and user defined methods. 

Design of the Load Balancer for our Tomcat and Glassfish servers

to run this on your machine you just need to have 

          - two severs running on 8080 amd 8082 port(you can configure others or edit them in the main class)
          - JDK 8+

Then just clone this repoitory: 
          
          - git clone https://github.com/NegusNati/distributed_project.git

=> then Run the main method simply

 You sould get something like this in your console, this one Round Robin Algorithm

And also added class response from Random Algorithm for Laod Balancing
